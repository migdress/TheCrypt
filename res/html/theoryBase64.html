	<strong>How does work?:</strong><br><br>
	<strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
	A character is transformed to its numeric value according to the charset,
	normally UTF-8, originally ASCII, for example the character 'M' has the value '77' in ASCII<br><br>
	<strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
	The numeric value (which is base 10) is converted to base2 or binary, conforming groups of 8 bits
	<strong>(It's important to understand that there have to be 8 bits, adding zeros ahead if needed)</strong>, 
	for example the numeric value '77' is represented with the 8-bit binary value '01001101'.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
	The total length of the 8-bit binary stream needs to be an exact multiple of 24, so for example for the 8-bit binary value '01001101' 
	to be encoded to base64, 16 bits more need to be added resulting a binary string like this '01001101<strong>0000000000000000</strong>',
	then the 24 bit stream is divided into groups of 6 bits (because 2<sup>6</sup>=64), resulting something like this '010011''010000'
	'000000'000000', those values are represented in base 10 as '19''16''0''0', resulting something like this '
	
	(Because 2*2*2*2*2*2=64, that's actually which is named base64) to represent a value of the alphabet.

	<p><strong>How does work?:</strong><br><br>
	<strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
	A character is transformed to its numeric value according to the charset,
	normally UTF-8, originally ASCII.<br>
	<strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
	Represent the numeric value (which is base 10) to base2 or binary, conforming groups of 8 bits (It's important to understand that there have to be 8 bits no matter zeros
	ahead).<br>
	<strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
	grouping the bits by 6 (Because 2*2*2*2*2*2=64, that's actually which is named base64) to represent a value of the alphabet.
